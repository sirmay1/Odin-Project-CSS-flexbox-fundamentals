This is the Odin Project for the CSS section. You are asked to create a landing site using flexbox and 
some other tools for web development in creating within the parameters a site particular to the rules 
layed out for you. It is a generalized website and can be developed with a particular personal theme in 
mind but within the rules of development given to you by the creators of the Odin Project.

How I will begin the project is the create the overall layout and from there add in the smaller box models 
and elements into the larger overal design of the landing page.
